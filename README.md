# ML Model Deployment using Flask

## Overview

This repository contains the files to create a basic ML web app using Flask. The model used here is trained on the data provided in **"Tabular Playground Series - Jan 2021"** Kaggle competition. 

## Instructions

1. [This](https://www.kaggle.com/harshitt21/tabular-playground-series-eda-model) is the script used to create the model that is deployed. 

2. The goal of creating this ML app was just to try deploying ML models. I used Flask as it is easy to learn. Will be trying Streamlit after this.  

3. I've deployed this on [Heroku](https://ml-app-deploy-flask.herokuapp.com), you can re-create this on your PC by cloning this repo and running:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python app.py
    ```
